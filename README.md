# STA141b_Project

We plan to make use of the Yelp API to develope an R Shiny app that will allow users to select their local restaurant and then see relevent statistics on that restuarant 
and the overall ratings for the city it is located in.

We are using sources and referencing material provided my RShiny tutorial

Additionally we will be using "Yelp Fusion"
